UPGRADING THE FOF CONSCRIPTOR

There are two ways to upgrade the FOF Conscriptor:

  * The easy way
  * The not quite as easy way

Here are the details on these two fabulous methods.

  THE EASY WAY
****************

The easy way blows away the database in one swoop, making your database perfect for the current
version.

When you unzip the conscriptor.zip file, it contains all the files needed except the file

/includes/config.inc.php

If you unzip your file on top of an old installation, you must remove this file to force the
re-install.  If you replace an existing installation with the newly unzipped folder, the config
file should not exist, so it will run the installer.

This file is created when installing the Conscriptor.  If you want to wipe out the database
and start over, just delete this file.  By the same token, if you unzip a new version of
the Conscriptor on top of an old version, you can delete this file to force it to re-install.
NOTE: The installer script will NOT run if the config.inc.php file exists.

*****************************
  THE NOT QUITE AS EASY WAY
*****************************

If you have version 1.0 or greater, you don't have to do a complete re-install to update your
system.  This means that you can perform the update on a live draft.  Here are the steps involved:

1. Back up your database and current copy of the conscriptor!  In the event that the upgrade goes
   south, you will want to be able to recover your existing installation.

2. Unzip the conscriptor.zip on top of the old directory, or copy the /includes/config.inc.php
   file into the new copy.

3. Look in the /includes/mysql folder for a MySQL upgrade script.  The upgrade script will be
   named "upgrade_X_X.sql" where the X_X corresponds to the version that the upgrader needs to be run for.
   For example, if you have version 1.0 and you see upgrade_1_1.sql, and the new version is 1.2, you
   will need to run upgrade_1_1.sql to get there.  If you are on version 4.5 and you are upgrading to
   4.9, and you see upgrade_4_6.sql and upgrade_4_8.sql, run those two files in order (upgrade_4_6.sql
   would bring you up to the database scema for 4.7 and 4.8, upgrade_4_8.sql would bring you up to date
   for 4.9, etc).  The easiest way to run these scripts is to import them in phpMyAdmin, or if you have
   terminal access just run the command:

      mysql -u[username] -p [database] < upgrade_X_X.sql
   
   This will bring your database up to the current version and you will be ready to go!

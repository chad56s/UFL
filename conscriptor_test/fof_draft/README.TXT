************************************************************************************

Thanks for using the Front Office Football Conscriptor.  This app is very easy to set up,
but here is a short list of instructions to get you started.

Here is how the Front Office Football Conscriptor works: 

  * If you do not have a user account, regsiter on the main page.
    NOTE: YOUR USER ID WILL BE YOUR TEAM'S IN-GAME ABBREVIATION. 

  * Log in and choose the players that you are interested in. 

  * When you've chosen the players you're interested in, set a priority for each player. 

  * You can go as deep into the draft as you want, setting as many priorities as you want. 

  * When the highest-rated player is selected, by default the program will delete other players in their queue
    at the same position. This setting can be changed under "Options." 

  * If the next player has picks selected, the program chooses their highest priority from the available players,
    and so on, until it runs out of players to choose from. 

  * The admin can choose for the team that's on the clock if they are taking too long or are an CPU team.

  * The admin can also skip a team that is on the clock.  A team that has been skipped may make their selection
    at any time.

  * The admin may set a time limit for picks, as well as a window where that time limit is in effect.
    If a team does not make a selection by the time limit, they are automatically skipped.  The admin may
    also set each team's relative time limit, i.e. 100%, 75%, 50%, etc. of the actual limit, if a team
    continues to miss picks (depending on your draft rules)

***********************
  SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
***********************

The FOF Conscriptor was built on PHP 5.2.5 and MySQL 5.0.45.  PHP 4 will run the utility successfully with the
exception of the installer.  See the workaround below.  The system does use some functions that require MySQL 5.
For best results, please use PHP 5 and MySQL 5.

********************
  NEW INSTALLATION 
********************

  * You need a webserver and you need a MySQL database. 

  * Unzip the file into a directory on your webserver (it unzips to "fof_draft") and then navigate
    to that directory. Make sure the webserver can write to the "includes" directory, and make sure
    you have a database you can store the data in. 

  * In your web browser open the "fof_draft" directory, and you will be prompted with information on
    how to install. 

  * The installation script will write a file in the includes directory called "config.inc.php." 
    *** If you need to re-install for any reason, simply remove this file.
    *** Installing will delete any existing database tables, but it is not necessary to re-install to start a new draft. 

  * Once you finish the install, sign in as the admin user you just created, and follow the instructions to import
    the draft data. There will be two files, the "players" file and the "draft order" file. Directions on how to
    get those files are displayed on the upload screen. 

  * Once the program is installed, have your players register. On the login page is the registration link, each
    team just needs to enter the 3-character code for their team (i.e. DEN or SEA) and set a password. I didn't
    make any deeper security than that, I figured that would be easier than the admin assigning passwords to
    everyone and since it's unlikely that anyone will try to hack into your draft I choose ease of use over security. 

  * The admin can lock out a team by turning on the "has password" checkbox under the "users" tab. This may be
    done to prevent malicious users from registering as an AI team. Again, since FOF MP is such a community game,
    if you have users who would do that they probably should be expelled from your league! 

*******************************
  PHP 4 INSTALLING WORKAROUND
*******************************

The installer creates the database and writes a config file.  PHP 4 does not have the function used to
actually write the config file, so you must create the config file manually.  Run the installer as usual,
but you will get an error about the function "file_put_contents" not being defined.  You must run the installer
to create the database,   There is a sample config file at fof_draft/includes/config.inc.php.sample, copy that file
to fof_fraft/includes/config.inc.php, changing the appropriate values for connecting to the database.  Once you
do this, you should be good to go.

****************
 ADVANCED USERS
****************

You can further secure your draft by using an .htaccess password on the directory, most
hosting providers give you tools to set that up, and if you have your own server you probably already
know how to do that as well.  If you want to manually set passwords for the teams, you can do that directly
in the database, the passwords are stored in plain text so you can just enter passwords using phpMyAdmin
or any other MySQL utility.  You can even change the team names, they will show up accordnigly in all
the reports, and the users will need use the new team name to be able to sign in.  If you change the "admin"
team, it will change the login required for the admin.  You should not, however, change the "xxx" team
(if it exists), doing that will mess up the ability to remove or restore draft picks for a team.

  UPGRADING
*************

Please read the UPGRADE.TXT file for information on upgrading.

************************
  E-MAIL NOTIFICATIONS 
************************

E-mail notifications of each pick that is made will automatically be sent to the admin's e-mail address
as well as any team that has entered an e-mail address for themselves if you turn this option on in the
admin options tab.  Some web hosting services do not cache outgoing e-mails efficently to reduce spam
sent by their members; as a result, the player selection process may time out.  Because of this, e-mail
notifications are disabled by default.  The admin does receive all e-mail notifications even if this setting
is turned off.

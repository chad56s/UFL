************************************************************************************

Version 0.1

Initial Release

---------------------

Version 0.4

Added filters for the players and selections
Fixed the draft order import if a team lost their draft pick (and are listed as 'xxx')

---------------------

Version 0.5

Added the ability to send e-mail notifications for each pick.  A global e-mail may be set
by editing the config.inc.php file, or each team may sign up in the options section.

Added a button to re-number your priority list in multiples of 10 for easy re-arranging

Enabled deleting of selections in the priority page

Made the player gray and italic in the priority list if their priority is 0

Fixed the importer so it doesn't break when there are commas in the school name

---------------------

Version 0.6

Fixed the e-mail notification, in version 0.5 it only sent if there was a global
e-mail notifcation set.

Added the ability for the admin to change the team that is selecting in a given round.

Added the admin e-mail account, which will be sent all draft notifications as well as
will be the e-mail address that the notifications come from.

---------------------

Version 0.7

Gave the admin account the ability to clear passwords or lock teams out by assigning
a random password (for AI teams, for example).  This area also shows the number of
players in each team's queue.

Gave the team an option to turn autopick off.  The admin can turn it back on if they are
waiting on the team.  When autopick is off, the team may select the player from the "Priority"
screen directly.

---------------------

Version 0.8

Tracking the time that each team is on the clock and reporting it in the header

Put more information about each player on the players screen

The option to zero out the priority of a position after you have selected a player of that position
is now able to be turned off

The admin may now stop the draft at any pick

The admin may now roll back the draft, returning players to the board

Teams may choose to make a player list or a list of "Best Player Available" based on general score
or by any of the other values that are recorded for the players.

-----------------------

Version 0.9

Added a chat feature

-----------------------

Version 0.10

Fixed a bug that caused the BPA selections to mess up if the attempted pick has already been selected

-----------------------

Version 0.11

Fixed a bug where if you had another app on the server using the session variable 'login' it would
mess up the logging in process for Conscriptor

-----------------------

Version 0.12

Restricted the team name field when registering to 3 characters

-----------------------

Version 0.13

The admin now can see the full chat transcript with time stamps.  Individual users will only see
the area of the chat while they are logged in.

Changed the player pick function to prevent a potential race condition if there are more than one
admin and they both pick for the same team at the same time (with two different players)

Added the ability for the admin to view any team's player queue

Added the ability for the admin to skip a team's pick, in the event that they run out of time
and the admin does not want to pick for them.  Skipping a pick will allow that team to come back
and make a selection at any time.

-----------------------

Version 0.14

Teams can now send their pick to another team.

Added the actual pick number next to the round-pick display.

Added the ability to add comments to players in your priority list.

-----------------------

Version 0.15

Added the team 'xxx' to the list.  This allows the admin to remove a draft pick.

Enabled the comments and "make selection" on the player list (so you don't have to add them to
your priority list to do those things)

The chat now pops up on all screens as it is happening.

Changed the e-mails so that they are a single BCC e-mail instead of sending individual
e-mails to each team.  This will hopefully fix the issue where the database was timing out
on some servers because it was taking so long for the e-mails to be sent.  Also made it so
that the admin can turn off the e-mails if it still times out the server (and made the
default setting to be e-mails off)

Added the ability for the picks to have a time limit and be automatically skipped.  Also
added a clock where the time limit applies.

------------------------

Version 0.16

The admin still gets e-mail notices even if the e-mail is turned off.

Added the ability for each team's clock to be adjusted by a percentage of the regular pick clock.

Teams now can choose what columns they want to display in the lists.

Added all columns that Extractor exports as available for the lists.  Some of course will not be applicable,
depending on whether you are doing a full draft or an amateur draft.  This includes the bar values!

Changed BPA to use the bar values.

Allowed the user to upload their own Extractor export so that they can see their scout's impression

Fixed a bug that caused a manual pick to fill a prior skipped pick.  Priority picks worked fine.

------------------------

Version 0.17

Added the player detail page.

------------------------

Version 0.18

The position drill was changed from a bar to just the value on the player info page.

Changed it so that the draft must be stopped to change the pick time and window, as doing that during a running
draft would cause unpredictable results.

Added an experience limit to the BPA selection method

Added the ability for the admin to add teams

Added combine color coding to match the in-game colors.  Also added height and weight comments on the player details.

------------------------

Version 1.0

Added a private chat feature.

Added sound effects to the chat.  Sounds are in the mp3 folder and may be replaced with any mp3 file.

Added an asterisk to the team name if they are set to autopick and have players in their queue.

Modified the admin user list so that they can see whether a team has a Player List queue or a BPA queue,
and how many active selections are in that queue.

Changed the draft uploader to not delete existing teams.

------------------------

Version 1.1

Importing a new draft did not clear the comments from the previous draft.

------------------------

Version 1.2

Fixed a bug in the importer that was assigning positional values incorrectly.

Fixed a bug that was displaying the player rating incorrectly (if the player was not a rookie).

Added a general "notes" tab for teams to write notes to themselves not specific to any player.

Added the ability to upload the grade/adjusted grade info.  This is optional but helpful.

Added the "Adjusted Grade" criteria to the BPA.

------------------------

Version 1.3

Added an analyzer dump to the menu.

Changed it so that if you are not logged in, you still can see the selections.

Added the ability to automatically add the 0-priority players to the end of your priority list.

Added the option for teams who time out on the clock to have their selection made automatically, using
the following logic: 1) If they have a player queue but have their auto-pick off, it picks from the queue.
2) If not, it will pick the best player available at a position that they have not selected yet in the
draft.  If there are no players that fit that criteria (i.e. all positions have been selected), then it
picks the best player available.

Fixed a bug that would turn off the countdown clock if you changed options while the draft clock was running.

Added a checkbox to filter out overrated playes in the players list.

Added the ability to go to the previous/next in your priority queue from the player info page.

------------------------

Version 1.4

Fixed the analyzer dump so it displays in a new window instead of downloading to a text file.

Fixed the bars for TE, Endurance and Special Teams were missing, Long Snapping was assigned to Endurance.

Fixed the birthday display, all birthdays were showing as the 12th of the month.

Added the ability to delay the autopick by up to thirty minutes.

Added a widget that can be embedded on a league homepage.

------------------------

Version 1.5

Added an option for e-mails to only be sent to the team that is on the clock, in addition to the existing
all picks and no e-mails.

------------------------

Version 1.6

Fixed a bug where comments made on the player info page were not saved correctly.

------------------------

Version 1.7

Allowing persistent logins.

------------------------

Version 1.8

Fixed a bug that was showing the "rating" value as the most recently uploaded team's scout impression.
Other bars were not affected.

------------------------

Version 1.9

Changed the analyzer dump to display the line breaks correctly

------------------------

Version 1.10

Put the timestamp on the chat for everyone (previously the admin only had the timestamp).

Named the text box for the chat a random name so that it doesn't autofill your chat text.

Added some verification to the Extractor upload so you can't upload old versions of the Extractor (which caused
corrupt data) and also let you know if you uploaded the wrong file (no players matched).

Fixed a logic bug that caused a team to autopick immediately if they had autopick turned off and 0 as the
autopick wait time.

Corrected an error in the calculations of the pick time limit if the team goes on the clock but the time
needs to wrap around to the next day.

------------------------

Version 1.11

Fixed a bug in the auto-picking where if a delay was set and the team's expiration time went into the next day,
the pick would wait until the next day to fire.

Fixed the analyzer dump to display picks in order and give scrollbars.

Writes to the error log the details of any changed pick.

If a team has a delay on their autopick it now shows in the selections list next to the asterisk.

The user tab in the admin now displays the number of times a team has had their time expire.

Fixed the "reorder priority list appending players with 0 to the end of the list."  Previously it was
also sorting the existing list in adjusted grade order, then appending the 0-priority players in
adjusted grade order.

Gave the option for when a pick goes on the clock and will expire after the end of the day's pick
to either keep the same pick time or roll into the next day.

Fixed the admin options to enable turning the 24-hour clock back on

Fixed the "keep me signed in" cookie so that if an incorrect password is entered it doesn't get stuck
in an infinite redirect loop.

Changed the chat so that when you first log in it pulls the chat from the previous two hours
rather than just when you first log in.

Keeps track of the number of teams each team has run out of time and been autopicked.

The admin can now have the pick time limit reduce for any team whose time expires.  This value is
a percentage, so having it set to 0% will have no reduction, 50% will have the time cut in half
each time (with a one hour limit the first miss will reduce their time to 30 minutes, the second to 15,
the third to 7, and so on), 100% will immediately take that team to an immediate pick for all future
selections.

Fixed the user list when sorted by the clock adjustment.
.
------------------------

Version 1.12

Added the ability to change the time zone for the draft times.  Changing during a draft may cause strange
things to happen with the chat (users may appear to be online who are not).  I only put in the US time zones,
but if you want to add time zones you may by adding entries in the time_zone table.  You will get an error
message if the time zone you entered does not have valid data.  If you get this error using the built-in time
zones, you may not be able to use this feature.  To use the time zone of your system, just set the time zone
to "Use Server's Time Zone."

------------------------

Version 1.13

Changed the BPA algorithm to use the current rating, then future rating for players who don't have an adjusted grade
(this is for full drafts).

------------------------

Version 1.14

Changed the max for the formation bar for a QB to 17.

Added the ability to import the Popularity value that is exported from the Interrogator.

------------------------

Version 1.15

Fixed the player popularity tell column to be distinguished from the regular player popularity column.

------------------------

Version 1.16

Fixed the Daylight Saving Time bug (you have to now select EDT or EST for the time zone)

------------------------

Version 1.17

Fixed a bug where the admin user list was showing the player queue count incorrectly

------------------------

Version 1.18

Fixed the player rating on the player card page.

Fixed the player rating on the list so that if a team hasn't uploaded an extractor report,
it shows the initial uploaded values.

------------------------

Version 1.19

You can now upload an extractor export of the entire league and do a mock draft.  This will
also enable scout picks, which will pick based on the team's strengths.

Added the ability to limit the autopick delay.

------------------------

Version 1.20

Forced picks now ignore P and K unless all other positions have been selected.

Enabled "current rating" and "future rating" in BPA lists (for allocation drafts)

Randomized the scout pick somewhat, so that the mock draft doesn't always match the actual selections.

------------------------

Version 1.21

Clearing a team's password also clears the e-mail address.

------------------------

Version 1.22

Clearing a team's password sets their clock adjustment value to 0.  Setting a dummy password also
sets their clock adjustment value to 0.  When a team registers, their clock adjustment value
is set to 100%.

Mock draft now has commentary on each pick.

------------------------

Version 1.23

Fixed a bug where the mock draft/scout pick would break if the player list was not uploaded
in adjusted grade order.  Some 1.22.X versions may have problems.

Added the ability to adjust the weight for each position for the scout picks.

------------------------

Version 1.24

Apostrophes in the team name broke the mock draft.

Adding a link for text for posting the first round in a forum.

Added some more phrases to the AI.

------------------------

Version 1.25

The chat page now scrolls to the end of the chat when loaded.

"Show Attributes" and "Filter Overrated" now stay checked if you select players from the players list.

New pick method option: Player Queue then Best At Position.  Selecting this option will use your player queue
until it is empty, and then will use the BPA queue.

------------------------

Version 1.26

Added effects to the alert messages.

Added some debugging code for developer troubleshooting.

Removing all now() functions in the MySQL code, instead having PHP do all the time calculations.  This should prevent
the PHP and MySQL clock from getting out of sync.

Adding a bell tone when you go on the clock.

Passwords are now encrypted

------------------------

Version 1.27

Previous versions were expecting magic quotes to be on.  This allowed for SQL injection attacks if
magic quotes is off, and magic quotes is being depreciated.  The app now tests for magic quotes
and, if off, adds slashes to the input.

------------------------

Version 1.27.2

Turned autocomplete off for the chat

------------------------

Version 1.27.3

Locking the database when the pick calculations are run.  This prevents a race condition
where picks were choosing two of the same position, even though the team had the checkbox
on to zero out players of the same position.

------------------------

Version 1.27.4

Changed to use MooTools, modified the chat code to hopefully be more stable and consistent

------------------------

Version 1.27.5

Changed the pick processing to prevent a race condition where multiple e-mails were being sent
on each pick

Making the e-mail notification subject the same for all e-mails (removing the round and pick number)

------------------------

Version 1.28

Owners can now choose whether they receive all e-mails or just the e-mails when they go on the clock.
The admin's options override the owner's if the admin sets it to only send e-mails to the team on the clock
or none at all.

------------------------

Version 1.28.1

Priority list is now sortable by dragging and dropping.  Also added a quick-add function.
